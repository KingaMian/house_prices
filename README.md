# Predicting_house_prices
Data Science and Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project consists of two parts:
1. Regression problem - pridicting house price
2. Classification problem - predicting if house price is above of below 600,000$

## Goals
The goal is to test different Machine Learning techniques and select the best one - with the best accuracy in predictions).

## Data
All datasets come from [https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)

## Scope of work
* 01 Data analysis and data preprocessing
* 02 Regression - modeling and evaluation
* 03 Classification - modeling and evaluation

## Final results
The best machine learning model for regression problem - Multi-layer Perceptron regressor (R-suquared 0.86)
The best machine learning model for classification problem - XGBoost Classifier (accuracy 93%)
